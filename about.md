Buisness Value :
--------------------
This Application will take the user filteration properties, integrate with expedia, preset the returned offers.

Programming Language:
---------------------
Java 6 
Im a Java Developer, I used plain servlets and JSPs to make things simple and straight forward, 
although i would usually use struts 2 and i would build my own custum tags to present the data .

Algorithims:
--------------------
Refelctions used to build integration request and parse response

Github & Heroku 
--------------------
Never used one of the above, i have spend more than 10 h to figure out how to commit the code and deploy it, 
it really made me busy while i was trying to focus on the application logic

Testing
--------
i had no time to perform any kind of JUnit testing, and im not familire with sandbox.

Presenting Data
----------------
I was concerned to view the most important information about the offers returned, 
in terms of average price and availabilty, if i had time i would present some images ,the location info, the URL for each hotel

Security
----------
all data enterd by the user is filtered.
this is a simple security validation only.


Note : 
------
application was build originaly on RAD and deployed on websphere, then recreated as a maven project with tomcat server.
