In this application i used
Java 1.7
Tomcat 7
maven 3.3.9

+ The code was plain JSP and servlets, to keep things simple
+ JSON Parser was used for the response parsing
+ Reflection was used to build the query string

Could not deploy the code to Heroku , with the below deployment log
--No default language could be detected for this app.     			
--HINT: This occurs when Heroku cannot detect the buildpack to use for this application automatically

No Sandbox test is available
